Since the Wi-Fi signal has the ability to pass through objects and also decays through objects, we use this property to map the occluded objects. We use the new algorithm of compressive sensing to do the mapping by collecting only very little data. We can also determine the accurate position and shape of the obstacles, which helps in localization of occluded objects inside the enclosed space. Hence our proposed project does the mapping efficiently with minimum amount of measurements and also maps the objects occluded from the view."
